# Writer assignment

Writer assignment identifies the developer or agent currently allowed to edit
one path's writable [worktree](./worktree.md).

## Build the idea

A worktree isolates files between paths but does not stop two processes from
editing the same directory. Exclusive mutation therefore requires a social
assignment or a mechanically enforced lease.

## In Cairn

One writer is assigned at a time. Other participants may inspect, test, or
review. Assignment may pass to another developer or agent only at a completed
remote checkpoint, with the handoff and path record refreshed before the new
writer begins.

## It does not prove

The reference tools record and expect the assignment but do not implement
a lease or allocator.
