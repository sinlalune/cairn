# Tamper evidence

Tamper evidence means a change becomes detectable when compared with a
previously known reference.

## Build the idea

Git hashes cover commit content and ancestry. Rewriting recorded history changes
the descendant hashes, so someone retaining an earlier trusted hash can detect
the difference.

## In Cairn

Exact subject hashes bind audit and acceptance to content. Independent protected
refs, signatures, or external anchors are required when writers may act
adversarially.

## It does not prove

Git history is not immutable merely because it is hashed. Without a previously
trusted reference, a rewritten history may look internally consistent.
