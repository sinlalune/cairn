# Path record

A path record is `project/coding-paths/CP-<ID>.md`, the portable role path and
durable source of truth for one [coding path](./coding-path.md).

## In Cairn

Frontmatter carries identity, [route](./route.md), lifecycle state,
base commit, branch, current step, writer assignment, subject commit when ready,
and two declared surfaces:

- **`writes:`** — the [declared write surface](./declared-write-surface.md), the
  paths this work expects to change;
- **`governs:`** — the declared read surface: the documents this work is bound
  by, each pinned as `path@<object-id>` so that "which knowledge applied" is a
  fact rather than a recollection.

The two together define the path's footprint in the repository, and their union
is what the [acceptance-drift](./acceptance-drift.md) predicate tests a moving
trunk against.

The body carries the outcome, definition of done, ordered execution plan, work
ledger, checkpoint, next action, and blockers. The section a `scope_ref` names
is the accepted definition of done, and its [scope digest](./scope-digest.md)
binds that text for the life of the acceptance.

The record advances with every work unit. After acceptance, the only fields
[administrative closure](./administrative-closure.md) may touch are `status`,
`subject_commit`, and an appended ledger entry — because the definition of done
lives in this same file, and closure must not be able to rewrite what acceptance
was measured against.

When execution ends the record is retained and eventually archived rather than
deleted.

## It does not prove

A path record can describe work that is not yet implemented. Commit ancestry,
checks, audit, and acceptance provide separate evidence.
