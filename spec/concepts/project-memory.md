# Project memory

Project memory is the information future participants need to understand,
verify, and continue work without access to the conversation that produced it.

## Build the idea

Its unit is the file: a named sequence of content stored at a path. Text in a
conversation disappears from the project when the conversation ends. A file can
be opened by another process later, compared with an earlier version, and
included in a [commit](./commit.md); its path also gives other files a stable
way to refer to it.

Cairn therefore makes files the smallest durable records. A path record
carries execution state and the acceptance that opened it; a step file carries
one unit's work; a journal entry carries one integrated outcome. Each important
statement has one canonical file rather than several manually maintained
copies — and where the forge natively keeps a record, the review of a
candidate, Cairn uses that rather than a copy.

## In Cairn

Project memory has two durable planes. `docs/` records what the system is and
why: [architecture](./architecture.md), [decisions](./decision-record.md), and
[implemented-area notes](./module-note.md). The portable role path `project/`
records what bounded work is doing now: paths, sessions, audits, handoffs, and
integrated outcomes.

`project/` is a protocol **role name**, not a required folder name. Which folder
a given repository installs it in is recorded once, in its
`project/coding-paths/binding.md`, under the
[host-binding boundary](../reference/repository-layout.md#host-binding-appendix),
and nowhere in the portable articles.

The path ledger connects them by recording which knowledge governed a concrete
work unit and which knowledge changed with it. A path's
[`governs:`](./path-record.md) declaration pins each governing document at an
exact [object id](./commit-hash.md), so "which knowledge applied" is a fact
rather than a memory.

## It does not prove

Persistence is not truth. A file can be incomplete or wrong, so Cairn combines
records with review and executable evidence. Canonical ownership prevents
conflicting sources; tests and review evaluate the claims themselves.
