# Live view

A live view is a generated navigation [file](./project-memory.md), canonically
`project/coding-paths/ACTIVE.md`.

## In Cairn

It derives from path records and lists `running`, `blocked`, and `ready` paths
with the information needed to find them. The generator rewrites it
deterministically and the checker compares the result with its source records.

## It does not prove

The live view is not a second state store. Hand edits can agree locally while
disagreeing with the path corpus, so they are prohibited.

Related: [path record](./path-record.md), [running state](./lifecycle.md),
[ready state](./lifecycle.md).
