# Journal

The Cairn journal is the set of integrated-outcome records under the portable
role path `project/log/` — one file per integrated outcome, never one appended
file.

## In Cairn

Each integration creates a uniquely named file such as
`YYYY-MM-DD-cp-example-001.md`. It names the path, candidate, remote integration
identity, outcome, and remaining work. Existing entries are immutable.

One file per event avoids merge collisions and makes each record independently
addressable.

## It does not prove

A folder-wide `log.md` is a navigation view, not the append-only journal, and
the journal does not replace commit history.
