# Implementation reference

The [canonical specification](../index.md) teaches and defines the protocol.
The [concept wiki](../concepts/index.md) explains one object per article. This
reference supplies exact forms:

- [Repository layout](./repository-layout.md) — directories, file roles, and
  naming conventions.
- [Execution protocol](./execution-protocol.md) — the ordered portable route for
  entering, advancing, handing off, resuming, and closing one path.
- [Coding-path template](./path-template.md) — a complete path record.
- [Handoff-brief contract](./handoff-brief.md) — frontmatter fields, capped body
  sections, and the answerable-alone test.
- [Human records](./human-records.md) — opening, audit, and closing schemas.
- [Operations](./operations.md) — registration, checkpoints, exact-candidate
  closure, integration, and cleanup.
- [Repair procedures](./repair.md) — what to do when a path has already
  violated the protocol.
- [Configuration](./configuration.md) — the versioned portability contract and
  its current implementation status.
- [Conformance](./conformance.md) — the matrix of what the reference tools
  check, the generated rule catalogue and linkage, and the weight budget.

Reference pages do not add requirements. If a reference and the specification
disagree, the specification is authoritative and the disagreement is a defect.
