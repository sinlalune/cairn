# Coding-path template

A path record is **born sliced**: a folder whose `index.md` carries the live
header that does not grow, whose forward plan is `plan.md`, and whose steps are
one file each under `steps/`. Create it in that shape — a record created flat is
a migration handed to whoever inherits it.

```text
project/coding-paths/CP-<ID>/
├── index.md      identity, goal, definition of done, coverage, step index
├── log.md        newest-first readable history of this record
├── plan.md       forward steps, explanatory until executed
└── steps/
    ├── index.md  one load-bearing line per step
    ├── log.md
    └── S<NN>.md  one complete step record, written to be read alone
```

The body below is `index.md`. Keep the path id, folder name, and branch
mechanically related; a portable implementation substitutes its configured
execution-state root. A flat `project/coding-paths/CP-<ID>.md` remains
conforming — every rule keys on the declared id, not the file carrying it — so an
existing flat record is not a defect and may migrate without restarting its
lifecycle.

# CP-EXAMPLE-001 — Short title

## Goal

State the observable result, not the activity.

## Definition of done

This section is what `scope_ref` resolves to, and its
[scope digest](../concepts/scope-digest.md) is recorded at opening acceptance
and re-verified at closing. Editing it after acceptance invalidates that
acceptance until a scope amendment is recorded.

- [ ] Product behaviour is implemented and covered by relevant tests.
- [ ] Affected architecture, decisions, module notes, and learning documents
      are current.
- [ ] Every completed step has one coherent ledger entry, refreshed handoff,
      commit, and remote checkpoint.
- [ ] The final implementation candidate is rebased, checked, audited, and
      accepted by exact full object id, with every provisional commit folded.
- [ ] The path reaches ready without implementation changes after acceptance.
- [ ] The exact integration candidate lands, the trunk records done, the remote
      result is proved, and the clean secondary worktree is removed safely.

## Documentation coverage

### Required

- `docs/architecture/example.md` — why this document governs the work

### Conditional

- `docs/architecture/security.md` — read before changing a trust boundary

### Deliberately excluded

- `docs/architecture/unrelated.md` — outside this path's bounded outcome

## Steps

One line per step, and this line is load-bearing: slicing saves nothing if a
reader cannot decide from it whether to open the file. Forward steps live in
`plan.md` until they are executed.

- **[S01](./steps/S01.md)** — what it established, in a phrase — COMPLETE
- **S02** — in progress; its file is linked when it is written

A step is linked only once its file exists: the gate refuses a link that
resolves nowhere, and the record is committed at registration before any step
has been executed.

No rollup operation exists. A step is written where it lives, and nothing is
summarised when it moves.

## Current checkpoint

```text
base commit : <trunk tip immediately before registration>
branch      : path/cp-example-001
writer      : <current assigned participant>
remote      : origin/path/cp-example-001 @ <last completed checkpoint>
gates       : exact latest verdicts
session     : safe boundary, or a pushed provisional commit under review
next action : exact next action
blockers    : none | named condition and unblock condition
cleanup plan: after remote integration proof, remove the exact clean secondary
              worktree without force
```

## Blockers

- None.
````

The step file `steps/S01.md` is a complete record on its own — deixis such as
*"the checkpoint below"* is a defect at authoring time, because the file will be
read alone:

# CP-EXAMPLE-001 S01

### S01 — title — **COMPLETE**

#### Intent

What this step set out to establish.

#### Work

```cairn-unit
step: S01
unit: 01
type: implementation
verified: cairn-check, typecheck, test, build
```

- implementation changed
- tests added or changed
- documents changed
- decisions, discoveries, reversals, and scope widening

#### Verification

```text
cairn-check : not run | pass | fail/inconclusive with reason
typecheck   : not run | pass | fail with reason
tests       : not run | pass | fail with reason
build       : not run | pass | fail with reason
user review : not required | awaiting pass | passed by <identity>
remote      : not pushed | origin/path/cp-example-001 @ <full commit>
```

#### Checkpoint

```text
status      : running
current step: S01 complete only after required review and remote proof
retention   : none (no-rewrite host) | refs/cairn/checkpoints/cp-example-001/g01/01
changed     : exact surfaces or concise groups
session     : safe boundary only after successful push
next action : S02 — exact first action
blockers    : none | named condition and responsible participant
```

## State-specific edits

### Registering

- record an accepted opening session;
- set `status: running`;
- set `base_commit` to the current trunk tip before registration;
- set `assigned_writer`;
- regenerate `ACTIVE.md`;
- land one metadata-only registration commit whose parent equals
  `base_commit`;
- only then create and push the path branch.

### Blocking

Set `status: blocked`, retain `branch` and `base_commit`, and name the blocker,
unblock condition, writer assignment, and last remote checkpoint. A path may
block from `running` when execution stalls and from `ready` when acceptance or
integration stalls; it returns only to `running`.

### Returning to running

Set `status: running` when execution resumes, when a ready candidate becomes
invalid by a finding, or when
[acceptance drift](../concepts/acceptance-drift.md) invalidates it because the
trunk moved inside `writes:` or `governs:`. Record why the transition occurred.

### Producing a candidate

On a no-rewrite host (`pathHistoryPolicy: forbidden`, the default) merge the
trunk into the branch, finish the candidate, and push `C` with an ordinary push.
Nothing is retained because nothing is rewritten, and provisional commits stay in
the history rather than being folded.

On a rewriting host (`retained`) retain every declared unit at
`refs/cairn/checkpoints/<path-id>/g<NN>/<unit>` before rebasing, where `<unit>` is
the ordinal in that entry's `cairn-unit` block and `g<NN>` is the generation still
current. Then rebase, fold every provisional commit into the work unit it was
drafting, and — in that same work unit, before the rewriting push completes —
open `g<NN+1>` by retaining every completed commit of the rebased branch from the
closed generation's floor upward. Move nothing. Then push `C`.

### Becoming ready

After exact candidate `C` has passed its checks, audit, and acceptance, create
one administrative commit that:

- sets `status: ready`;
- sets `subject_commit` to the full object id of `C`;
- appends one line to the record's folder `log.md`;
- regenerates the live view, which projects the status it just moved;
- adds the exact audit and exact closing record, and moves the brief's
  checkpoint pointer to `C`.

It changes no other field of this record — not the definition of done, not
`scope_ref`, not `writes:`, not `governs:`, not the step plan. The comparison
is against the record at `C`, so a `writes:` widened while the path ran is not
a closure change.

### Recording done

Only the trunk integration unit sets `status: done` and
`resolution: completed`. A path branch never claims done.

### Archiving

Set `status: archived` and exactly one resolution:

- `completed` after done;
- `abandoned` for stopped, unintegrated work;
- `superseded` for work replaced by another path or decision.

Keep the path record.

Return to [the path model](../index.md#put-one-bounded-change-on-a-coding-path)
or [lifecycle](../concepts/lifecycle.md).
