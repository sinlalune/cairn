# The handoff-brief contract

The [handoff brief](../concepts/handoff.md) is the protocol's bootstrap
document: the last stop on the entry route from `AGENTS.md`, and the first
document a new participant acts from. This page gives it exact fields, because a
bootstrap contract described only in prose is not a contract.

Filename:

```text
project/briefs/<lowercase-path-id>-handoff.md
```

One brief per path. It is **mutable** and rewritten at every completed
[work unit](../concepts/work-unit.md). The
[work ledger](../concepts/work-ledger.md) is the append-only history; the brief
says which part of that history is still the situation.

It can fail in either direction. Too thin, and the reader must go decide for
themselves which ledger entries still hold — the one judgement the brief exists
to make. Too thick, and it has re-narrated the ledger into a second ledger, and
the two will disagree about the past. The brief points at exact ids; it does not
retell.

## Frontmatter

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `written_by` | participant id | who refreshed this brief. Required so a cold-resume pilot can tell a practice problem from a schema problem; git authorship cannot, because one committer may publish several participants' work |
| `checkpoint` | full object id | the last **retained** checkpoint; the exact resume point |
| `checkpoint_unit` | ledger ordinal | that checkpoint's `unit:`, so the brief and its retention ref agree |
| `checkpoint_pushed` | boolean | whether `checkpoint` is present on the remote path branch. `false` is a defect to repair, not a state to hand over |
| `base_commit` | full object id | the trunk commit the path was registered from |
| `trunk_seen` | full object id | the trunk tip last fetched, so a reader knows how stale the path's view is |
| `writes` | list of path patterns | copied from the path record; what this path may change |
| `governs` | list of `path@<object-id>` | the documents that bind this work, each pinned at an exact id |
| `verify` | list of exact commands | run verbatim to confirm the checkpoint is what the brief says |

`checkpoint` cannot be the commit that contains the brief. A brief is refreshed
inside the work unit it describes, so at write time that commit does not exist —
the same self-reference the `cairn-unit` ordinal solves. It names the last
checkpoint that is already retained and resumable.

Before the first work unit there is no such checkpoint. The brief written at
registration, and the one refreshed inside the first unit, name the
**registration commit** with `checkpoint_unit: 0`: it is the exact commit a
resumer can start from, and zero is the honest ordinal of a unit that has not
landed.

`governs` entries MUST carry the `@<object-id>` pin. An unpinned document
reference means "read whatever this says now", which is precisely the ambiguity
the field exists to remove.

`verify` entries MUST be runnable as written, with no placeholder and no
description of a command. A reader must be able to paste them.

## Body — seven capped sections

The body holds these seven sections, in this order, and no others. Each SHOULD
stay within roughly 150 tokens. There is **no budget on the whole brief**: a
section that will not fit is separated, not compressed — the detail moves to the
record that owns it and the brief links there.

| Section | Answers | Cap guidance |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `## Outcome` | what this path is for, in one paragraph | ~100 tokens |
| `## State` | where the work stands at `checkpoint` | ~200 tokens |
| `## Next action` | the single next thing to do | ~120 tokens |
| `## Blockers` | the named condition and its unblock condition, or `none` | ~120 tokens |
| `## Tried and rejected` | approaches already eliminated, each with its reason | ~250 tokens |
| `## Reading order` | which `governs` documents to read, in what order, and why | ~200 tokens |
| `## Verification` | what the `verify` commands should produce | ~150 tokens |

**Next action is singular.** A list of three next actions is a plan, and plans
belong in the path record. The brief names the one action a resuming participant
should take before anything else.

**Tried and rejected is the section people skip and the one that saves the most
time.** Without it, a cold reader's first instinct is usually the approach the
last writer already eliminated, and they will spend an hour rediscovering why.

## The answerable-alone contract

"Alone" is about what the reader carries in their head, not about how many files
they may open. The entry route — `AGENTS.md` → operating convention → live view
→ path record → this brief — is the protocol working, and the brief's job is the
last link in it, not a replacement for the whole chain.

A reader holding `AGENTS.md`, this brief, and the repository at `checkpoint` —
with no conversation, no prior session, and no memory of how the path got here —
MUST be able to state:

| # | Question | Answered by |
| --: | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | the outcome this path is for | `## Outcome` |
| 2 | the exact commit to resume from | `checkpoint` + `checkpoint_unit` |
| 3 | the single next action | `## Next action` |
| 4 | what the path may write | `writes` |
| 5 | what it must read, and at which object id | `governs`, each pinned `path@<object-id>` |
| 6 | what is blocking, if anything | `## Blockers` |
| 7 | what has already been tried and rejected | `## Tried and rejected` |
| 8 | the exact commands that verify the checkpoint | `verify` + `## Verification` |

Each answer MUST be in this brief, or in a record this brief names at an exact
object id. An answer that survives only in a conversation, only in a previous
session, or only as a judgement about which ledger entries still hold is
**unanswerable**: the brief has failed its contract, and refreshing it is part of
the next work unit.

There is deliberately **no objective field in the frontmatter**. Question 1 is
prose and the frontmatter is machine-checkable state; the objective is restated
in `## Outcome` and argued at length in the path record. Maintaining it in two
schemas would guarantee that one of them is eventually wrong, and no predicate
can adjudicate between two prose paragraphs.

## Cold resume

The same test, run as a measurement: place a participant with no prior context
in front of `AGENTS.md`, this brief, and the repository at `checkpoint`, and ask
them to perform the next action. Record whether they did it correctly and how
long it took to the first correct action.

A trial MUST allow the participant to open any record the brief names at an
exact id — that is the contract, not a leak in it. What a trial MUST NOT supply
is anything undurable: a conversation, a previous session, a person to ask.

Record `written_by` and the path id with **every** trial. The aggregate over the
eight questions is the least useful reading: failures clustering by writer mean
the schema is fine and the practice is not, failures clustering by path mean the
schema is underspecified for a class of work, and those point in opposite
directions. The aggregate hides which one you are in.

This is the pilot's **primary** metric, ahead of ceremony time, artifact count,
or advisory volume. A protocol whose briefs cannot be resumed cold has failed at
the thing it exists for, however cheap its ceremony has become.

# Resume CP-EXAMPLE-001 here

## Outcome

One paragraph: the bounded result this path exists to produce.

## State

What is done at the checkpoint, and what is not.

## Next action

Exactly one action.

## Blockers

The named condition and what would clear it, or `none`.

## Tried and rejected

- Approach A — rejected because …
- Approach B — rejected because …

## Reading order

1. `docs/architecture/example.md@89ab…` — why it binds this work.
2. `docs/adr/ADR-004-example.md@cdef…` — the constraint it fixes.

## Verification

What `npm run cairn-check` and `npm test` should print at this checkpoint.
