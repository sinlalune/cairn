# Repository layout and binding boundary

The [specification](../index.md#the-repository-around-the-path) defines roles
before paths: application source, the Cairn
[control plane](../concepts/control-plane.md), durable project knowledge, and
durable execution state. A portable implementation may bind those roles to
folders it already has.

This page uses the protocol's own **role names** throughout — `project/`,
`docs/architecture/`. Which folder a given repository binds each role to is
recorded in its [host binding appendix](#host-binding-appendix). Nothing here
repeats an installed repository's local vocabulary, because a specification
that carries one adoption's folder names through every example is teaching that
adoption rather than the protocol.

## The reference tree

This tree is exhaustive for active Cairn-defined files, folder roles, and refs.
Angle brackets mark repeatable names. Application code, domain knowledge, and
non-normative research material may add files outside this tree without becoming
protocol structure.

`.git/refs/` is shown because two of Cairn's durable objects are refs rather
than files and are therefore invisible to every directory listing: the path
branches, and the [checkpoint retention](../concepts/checkpoint-retention.md)
namespace described [below](#the-cairn-ref-namespace). A reader who searches the
working tree for them finds nothing and reasonably concludes they do not exist.

`shared/` is a guarded source root supported by the example binding even when a
repository does not currently contain it. Repeatable records may be absent when
no event of that kind exists; their directory, index, and folder log still name
the role. `cairn.config.json`, its schema, and its loader are shown because the
reference tools now consume that binding before evaluating repository rules.

A host repository may of course hold folders Cairn says nothing about. Those are
that repository's business and are deliberately absent here: this tree lists
what Cairn defines, not what any one adoption happens to contain.

## What every part does

| Path | Role | Write rule |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `AGENTS.md` | small bootloader pointing participants to operating state and doctrine | change only with the protocol entry route |
| `cairn.config.json` | versioned machine-readable binding from portable roles to this host | host configuration change |
| `cairn.lock.json` | the protocol release installed here, and one digest per installed file, so an update can tell a pristine file from an edited one | written by `cairn-init`; never hand-edited |
| `tools/cairn-init.mjs` | transactional installer: resolves the whole file set, refuses to overwrite, rolls back on failure | independently reviewed control-plane change |
| `package.json` | exposes the reference commands without making Node a protocol requirement | control-plane change |
| `.github/workflows/cairn.yml` | current CI adapter; reports checks for the supplied comparison refs | independently reviewed control-plane change |
| `tools/cairn-check.mjs` | deterministic blocking and advisory predicates | independently reviewed control-plane change |
| `tools/cairn-config.mjs` | dependency-free binding loader and schema-2 validator | independently reviewed control-plane change |
| `tools/cairn-config.schema.json` | editor-readable schema for the installed binding | same work unit as the loader |
| `tools/cairn-active.mjs` | rebuilds the live-path projection | independently reviewed control-plane change |
| `tools/cairn-audit.mjs` | scaffolds and checks one exact-candidate audit | independently reviewed control-plane change |
| `tools/cairn-rules.mjs` | projects checker metadata into the rule catalogue | independently reviewed control-plane change |
| `tools/*.test.mjs` | executable contract for each reference tool | same work unit as the tool |
| `docs/architecture/` | accepted architecture and constitutional doctrine | path plus decision record when meaning changes |
| `docs/adr/ADR-*.md` | one durable architecture or protocol decision | path making the decision |
| `docs/modules/<area>.md` | implemented-area flow, boundaries, and tests | path changing that area |
| `spec/index.md` | canonical normative protocol | accepted specification change |
| `spec/concepts/*.md` | one explanatory article per specialised object | same specification work unit |
| `spec/reference/*.md` | exact layouts, schemas, and operations | same specification work unit |
| `site/` | generated self-contained reader | generator only |
| `project/index.md` | entry map for durable project knowledge and execution state | project-plane change |
| `project/coding-paths/paths.md` | portable operating convention for opening, running, integrating, and cleaning paths | accepted protocol operation change |
| `project/coding-paths/binding.md` | human-readable host adapter: installed roots, commands, worktree/runtime details, and local examples | host configuration change |
| `project/coding-paths/CP-<ID>/` | one path as one folder: declaration, opening acceptance, step index and resume section in `index.md`, forward plan in `plan.md`, one file per step under `steps/`; no folder log | current assigned writer |
| `project/coding-paths/CP-<ID>/steps/S<NN>.md` | one step's complete record, written to be read alone | append-only once written |
| `project/coding-paths/CP-*.md` | the same path as a flat record — the older shape, still conforming | current assigned writer |
| `project/coding-paths/ACTIVE.md` | generated live-path index | generator only |
| `project/coding-paths/history/*.md` | verbatim completed ledger sections rolled out of a FLAT record; a born-sliced record has no rollup and writes the step where it lives | created by that path; immutable thereafter |
| `project/sessions/*.md` | closing acceptances and other human decisions; opening acceptance lives in the path record | participant recording the event; immutable thereafter |
| `project/audits/*.md` | one audit bound to one full candidate hash | auditor; immutable thereafter |
| `project/log/*.md` | one integrated outcome per file | integration unit; immutable thereafter |
| `project/brainstorm/` | explicitly provisional thinking | normal path work; never treated as accepted doctrine |
| `refs/heads/path/<id>` | one path's branch, carrying every checkpoint it has pushed | current assigned writer |
| `refs/cairn/checkpoints/<id>/g<NN>/<n>` | one immovable pin per ledger-named checkpoint, inside the generation that was current when it was written | append-only; never moved or deleted while the path record lives |
| each meaningful folder's `index.md` | what belongs there and how to navigate it | update when folder meaning or contents change materially |
| a documentation folder's `log.md` | recent meaningful changes in that scope | newest-first folder history; not an event record. Path folders and the specification keep none: Git already holds the per-folder history |

The ownership classes are canonical knowledge, path-owned state, generated
views, mutable navigation, provisional knowledge, and immutable event records.
Independent events receive independent files so parallel paths do not append to
one shared record.

## The Cairn ref namespace

Not everything Cairn owns is a file. One ref namespace lives outside every
working tree and outside every directory listing:

```text
refs/cairn/checkpoints/<path-id>/g<NN>/<n>
```

**This namespace exists only where the host declares
`pathHistoryPolicy: retained`.** Under `forbidden` — the default
(**ADR-022**) — nothing is
rewritten, the branch itself keeps every ledger-named commit reachable, and this
part of the tree is simply absent.

Each ref pins one ledger-named checkpoint so that a rewriting push cannot orphan
it. `<n>` is the ledger's own ordinal for that checkpoint. `g<NN>` is the
[generation](../concepts/checkpoint-retention.md) — one linear version of the
branch, opened when a rewrite closes the previous one. The refs are append-only
for the life of the path record, and they are not released by integration.

The current generation is **derived, never stored**: it is the highest-numbered
generation present whose refs are all ancestors of the branch tip. Nothing in
this tree records it, and nothing should — a stored generation is a claim about
ancestry that ancestry can already answer, and the two drift apart at the first
rewrite. A ref written before this notation carries no generation segment; it
MUST NOT be moved into one. Opening a generation belongs to the same work unit
as the rewrite that forced it.

**Where this actually is.** Refs are not in the working tree, so no amount of
`ls` will find them. They live inside the repository's own database — under
`.git/refs/` and `.git/packed-refs` locally, and in the equivalent store on the
remote. Git will not show them with `git branch` either, because that command
only reads `refs/heads/`. Three commands make the namespace visible:

```bash
$ git for-each-ref refs/cairn/checkpoints          # every retained checkpoint here
$ git ls-remote origin 'refs/cairn/checkpoints/*'  # every one the remote holds
$ git show-ref cp-example-001                      # one path's pins
```

Being invisible to a file listing is the point: a record kept as a file can be
edited by the work it describes, and a checkpoint pin must survive exactly the
operation — a rewriting push — that rewrites files.

A repository that clones with a restricted refspec, or a mirror that copies only
`refs/heads/*`, will silently lose this namespace. Fetch configuration is part of
conforming to [checkpoint retention](../concepts/checkpoint-retention.md), not an
optional convenience.

## Host binding appendix

Everything above this heading uses role names. A repository trades them for its
installed folders, commands, branch, remote and runtime details in exactly one
human-readable file:

```text
project/coding-paths/binding.md
```

That file is classified **BINDING**, not PORTABLE. It names the host and MAY
contain application paths, local command names, worktree examples, runtime
variables and known conflict surfaces. The root `AGENTS.md` points to it beside
the portable path convention and
[execution protocol](./execution-protocol.md). Host architecture remains outside
the unconditional protocol route and is selected through each path's
documentation coverage.

The [configuration contract](./configuration.md) is the machine-readable
counterpart. The schema-2 loader resolves the installed binding for the
checker, active view, and audit scaffold. Schema migrations, installation,
updates, and generated host adapters remain open, so that loader is not by
itself a claim of complete portable conformance. Installed names still MUST NOT
leak into portable documentation.

## Naming relationships

### Path identity

```text
CP-ROADMAP-010
  → project/coding-paths/CP-ROADMAP-010/index.md   (the record, one folder)
  → project/coding-paths/CP-ROADMAP-010.md         (flat record, older shape)
  → path/cp-roadmap-010
```

A record's identity is the id it declares, not the file that carries it. Both
shapes above are the same path, and a record may migrate between them without
its registration, lifecycle or history appearing to restart. Every rule keys on
the id; a rule that keys on the filename is reading an address for a fact.

The id uses uppercase `CP-` followed by uppercase letters, digits, and hyphens.
It is stable, globally unique within the repository, and never reused. The
branch field remains present for `running`, `blocked`, and `ready`.

### Opening and closing records

```text
project/coding-paths/<PATH-ID>/index.md#opening-acceptance
project/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<lowercase-path-id>-closing.md
```

The opening acceptance is a section of the record. In the closing record,
root-level metadata, not the filename, defines `path` and `ceremony`.

### Audit record

```text
project/audits/<lowercase-path-id>-<full-40-character-subject-commit>.md
```

### Journal entry

```text
project/log/YYYY-MM-DD-<lowercase-path-id>.md
```

If a journal name would collide, add a stable subject suffix. Never overwrite
an existing entry.

## Derived relationships

```text
live path records
  └── project/coding-paths/ACTIVE.md

one flat path record
  └── project/coding-paths/history/<id>-S<NN>.md   (FLAT records only)

integrated path + exact audit + exact closing acceptance
  └── project/log/YYYY-MM-DD-<id>.md

canonical Markdown article graph
  └── site/
```

An arrow means “generated or projected from,” not “maintained as another
independent truth.”
