# Concepts

This wiki defines the specialised ideas used by the
[Cairn specification](../index.md). Each page is about one object or rule. It
starts with a plain definition, connects the idea to Cairn, and states its
limit. The specification remains normative.

The articles fall into two kinds, and keeping them apart matters more than it
looks. **Borrowed vocabulary** is what Cairn inherits from Git and from ordinary
software practice: a reader who already knows what a rebase is can skip all of
it, and a reader who does not can learn it here without learning Cairn at the
same time. **Cairn's own concepts** are the objects and rules the protocol
actually adds — the ideas you are being asked to evaluate.

Twenty-one borrowed terms, fifty Cairn concepts. A protocol that presents
those as one undifferentiated glossary looks twice as large as it is, and hides
which half a criticism belongs to.

## Borrowed vocabulary

Cairn did not invent these and does not redefine them. Each article says what
the term means in general use, then how Cairn relies on it.

### Git objects and history

[Git](./git.md) → [repository](./repository.md) → [commit](./commit.md) →
[object id](./commit-hash.md) → [branch](./branch.md) → [trunk](./trunk.md) →
[remote](./remote.md) → [fetch and push](./fetch-and-push.md) →
[tamper evidence](./tamper-evidence.md).

### Editable spaces and combining work

[Working tree and worktree](./worktree.md) → [conflict](./conflict.md) →
[rebase](./rebase.md) → [merge](./merge.md).

### Checking and describing

[Test](./test.md) → [exit code](./exit-code.md) →
[continuous integration](./continuous-integration.md) →
[Markdown and frontmatter](./frontmatter.md) → [schema](./schema.md).

### Documents software teams already keep

[Architecture](./architecture.md) → [decision record](./decision-record.md) →
[module note](./module-note.md).

## Cairn's own concepts

### One durable path

[Project memory](./project-memory.md) → [coding path](./coding-path.md) →
[path record](./path-record.md) →
[declared write surface](./declared-write-surface.md) →
[scope digest](./scope-digest.md) → [work unit](./work-unit.md) →
[work ledger](./work-ledger.md) →
[remote checkpoint](./remote-checkpoint.md) →
[provisional commit](./provisional-commit.md) →
[checkpoint retention](./checkpoint-retention.md) →
[handoff brief](./handoff.md) → [writer assignment](./writer-assignment.md).

### People and responsibilities

[Path initiator](./path-initiator.md) → [path writer](./path-writer.md) →
[authorised reviewer](./authorised-reviewer.md) → [auditor](./auditor.md) →
[Cairn checker](./cairn-checker.md) → [integrator](./integrator.md). The
[writer assignment](./writer-assignment.md) says which participant may mutate
the path worktree now.

### Evidence and records

[Blocking finding](./blocking-finding.md) →
[advisory finding](./advisory-finding.md) →
[inconclusive finding](./inconclusive-finding.md) →
[record integrity](./record-integrity.md).

### Open, execute, close, integrate

[Opening acceptance](./opening-acceptance.md) →
[trunk registration](./trunk-registration.md) → [live view](./live-view.md) →
[implementation candidate](./implementation-candidate.md) →
[coherence audit](./coherence-audit.md) →
[closing acceptance](./closing-acceptance.md) →
[acceptance drift](./acceptance-drift.md) →
[administrative closure](./administrative-closure.md) →
[integration transport](./integration-transport.md) → [journal](./journal.md).

### State

[Lifecycle](./lifecycle.md): [draft](./draft-state.md),
[running](./running-state.md), [blocked](./blocked-state.md),
[ready](./ready-state.md), [done](./done-state.md), and
[archived](./archived-state.md).

### Routes

[Route](./route.md) is the declared field; the routes it may name are
[lightweight path](./lightweight-path.md) — the default —
`full`, [foundation path](./foundation-path.md), and the not-yet-implemented
[emergency path](./emergency-path.md).

### Governance

[Control plane](./control-plane.md) →
[enforcement profile](./enforcement-profile.md) →
[conformance](./conformance.md).

### Whether a rule can be trusted

A rule is a sentence turned into code, and the join is where the defects live.
[Proxy predicate](./proxy-predicate.md) names the substitution,
[unsound gate](./unsound-gate.md) names what it produces,
[adversarial fixture](./adversarial-fixture.md) is the only evidence a rule
works, and [gate parity](./gate-parity.md) is the property that one gate does not
change its mind between a laptop and CI.
[Instruction parity](./instruction-parity.md) is its reader-side twin: one
protocol text produces one workflow, whoever reads it.
