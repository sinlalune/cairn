# Checkpoint retention

Checkpoint retention is the requirement that every commit a path's
[work ledger](./work-ledger.md) names remains reachable from a ref after the
path branch is rewritten.

## Build the idea

A [rebase](./rebase.md) reconstructs commits on a newer base, which changes
their [object ids](./commit-hash.md). Publishing the result replaces the remote
branch, and the original commits become unreachable — Git keeps the objects for
a while, then collects them.

That is ordinary Git behaviour, and for a throwaway branch it is harmless. It is
not harmless here. Cairn's ledger names its checkpoints by object id and
promises that another participant can fetch one and resume. After a rewriting
push, those ids resolve to nothing, and the promise fails exactly when it is
needed. Rebase-before-close therefore attacks resumability directly, not as a
side effect.

## In Cairn

Before any rewriting push of a path branch, every commit the ledger names MUST
already be reachable from a retention ref on the same remote:

```text
refs/cairn/checkpoints/<path-id>/g<NN>/<n>
```

`<n>` is the ledger's own ordinal for that checkpoint, so a ledger entry and its
retained ref name the same thing. Retention refs are append-only: a ref, once
pushed, is never moved or deleted while the path record is retained.

## Generations

Append-only and one slot per ordinal cannot both survive a rebase, and the rebase
is the thing this concept exists to survive. After one, unit 13 exists twice: the
commit it was verified as, and the reconstructed copy now on the branch. Both
deserve retention — the first because the ledger row points at it, the second
because the next rewrite will orphan it — and moving the ref to the second is how
you lose the first.

`g<NN>` is a **generation**: one linear version of the branch, opened when the
branch is created or rewritten, closed by the next rewriting push. Each
generation holds one of the two commits, nothing moves, and both promises hold.

Which generation is current is **derived, not recorded**: it is the highest one
present while all of its refs are still ancestors of the branch tip. A rewrite
announces itself — the refs it wrote stop being ancestors — so no counter has to
be maintained and no participant has to remember. A recorded generation would be
a claim about a fact the refs already carry, and a claim needs a rule of its own.

Opening a generation belongs to the rewrite that forced it, in the same work
unit: every completed commit of the rebased branch, from the current generation's
floor upward, is retained under the new number before the rewriting push
completes.

The `g` prefix is not decoration. A Git ref is a path, so a ref cannot be both a
leaf and a directory: with an ordinal generation segment,
`refs/cairn/checkpoints/<id>/01/14` is refused while the flat
`refs/cairn/checkpoints/<id>/01` exists. Keeping the generation out of the
ordinal alphabet is what lets refs written before this notation stay exactly
where they are — judged for reachability, never moved into a generation.

Settled by **ADR-021**.

A repository that cannot create or push that namespace has one other conforming
option — forbid rewriting pushes on path branches entirely, and reach a current
base by [merge](./merge.md) instead of rebase. Silently rewriting without
retention is not a third option.

**The namespace is not a branch, and it is not fetched by default.** `refs/cairn/*`
sits outside `refs/heads/*` and `refs/tags/*`, which are the only two namespaces
an ordinary clone or a CI checkout action retrieves. Any environment that judges
retention MUST fetch it explicitly:

```bash
git fetch origin '+refs/cairn/*:refs/cairn/*'
```

**An empty CURRENT GENERATION is a different claim, and the difference decides the
verdict.** An unfetched namespace and an unreadable branch range are both missing
evidence. A current generation that is empty *while older generations sit beside
it* is not: the namespace was read, the rewrite is visible in it, and nothing has
been retained since. That state is blocking and definite. Reading it as "nothing
to judge" is how the rule came to report `OK` at the exact moment the mandatory
pre-merge rebase had orphaned everything — 41 of 55 commits below the floor, 13
refs naming commits that had left the branch, gate green (CP-OPS-002 S08j).

An environment that has not fetched the namespace sees it empty, and an empty
namespace is **missing evidence, not evidence of absence** — the two are
indistinguishable from inside one checkout, because listing refs under a
namespace that was never fetched succeeds and prints nothing, exactly as listing
a namespace that is genuinely empty does. A checker MUST report that state as
[inconclusive](./inconclusive-finding.md) rather than as a set of confident
findings naming refs it cannot see.

## It does not prove

A retained ref proves an object is reachable, not that the working state it
captured was correct or complete. Retention also does not make history
immutable: a participant who can delete refs can delete these. It removes an
accident, not an adversary.

Nor does a *local* retention ref prove retention. The property is about the
remote: a ref that exists only in one working copy is orphaned by the same push
it was meant to survive. Retention is checked where the refs are visible and
claimed only for what a fetch can reach.
