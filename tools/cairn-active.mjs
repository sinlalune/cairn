/**
 * cairn-active — regenerate the live-paths view in ACTIVE.md.
 *
 * The owner's challenge (2026-08-14): "if an agent is merging it can
 * reconstruct those files on the go". Correct — and reconstructing beats
 * locking. Every path already declares its status, branch and base, so the
 * running list is a PROJECTION of those files rather than a source. Since
 * CP-OPS-001 S08, an accepted path declaration lands on the trunk BEFORE its
 * worktree branches. That registration is the missing precondition: without
 * it, this generator can be perfectly current for one checkout while being
 * globally false about sibling branches it cannot see.
 *
 * This matters more since the integrator was removed. With every path merging
 * itself, registration + derivation are what keep the global view complete
 * without giving one person ownership of it.
 *
 * Same doctrine the app already applies to its own views: files hold the
 * state, the view arranges references to it, and closing the view loses
 * nothing.
 *
 *   node tools/cairn-active.mjs           # rewrite the block
 *   node tools/cairn-active.mjs --check   # exit 1 if stale, write nothing
