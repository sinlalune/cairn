/**
 * cairn-init — install Cairn into a repository, transactionally.
 *
 * ADR-020 stage 5. What an adopter receives on day one is what they own from
 * day one, so this command installs the shapes the protocol currently states
 * rather than the ones it used to: born-sliced path records, and a no-rewrite
 * path history (ADR-022) whose retention namespace is absent rather than
 * scaffolded and unused.
 *
 * THREE CLASSES OF FILE, and the difference is the whole design (ADR-020):
 *
 *   PORTABLE  copied verbatim from the installation this runs from — the
 *             protocol, its concepts and references, and the reference tools.
 *             Never edited per host; an adopter who edits one is detectable
 *             through the lock manifest.
 *   HOST      generated for this repository — the binding, the config, the
 *             bootloader, the workflow.
 *   BINDING   the one human adapter, `binding.md`, generated from the answers
 *             given here and owned by the adopter thereafter.
 *
 * TRANSACTIONAL, stated precisely rather than sold as atomic: the complete file
 * set is resolved in memory, every conflict is detected before a single byte is
 * written, and a failure during writing removes what this run created. It does
 * not protect against a concurrent writer in the target, and it does not claim
 * POSIX atomicity across a directory tree.
 *
 * IT REFUSES TO OVERWRITE. Silently replacing a file an adopter has edited is
 * how a protocol upgrade destroys the work it was meant to preserve, so an
 * existing target file is a hard stop. `cairn.lock.json` records the release
 * identity and a digest per installed file, which is what a later migrator
 * needs to tell a pristine file from an edited one. The migrator itself is NOT
 * implemented here, and this file claims nothing about updates.

This file points; it does not carry project memory.

## Start here, in order

1. \`${options.projectRoot}/coding-paths/paths.md\` — the PORTABLE path
   convention: registration, one writer per worktree, checkpoints, closure.
2. \`${options.projectRoot}/coding-paths/binding.md\` — this repository's
   BINDING: exact roots, commands, branch and remote.
3. \`${PORTABLE_DOCS}/reference/execution-protocol.md\` —
   the portable per-session order.
4. \`${options.projectRoot}/coding-paths/ACTIVE.md\` — what is running now. It is
   generated; never hand-edit it.

## The mechanical contract

The exit code is the verdict. Never pipe a gate through another command — a
pipeline reports the LAST command's status, so \`gate | tail && commit\` commits
after a failure.

\`\`\`bash
npm run cairn-check     # the blocking and advisory rules, in full
npm run cairn-active    # regenerate the running-paths view
npm run cairn-audit     # scaffold the pre-merge coherence audit
npm test                # the tools' own fixture suite, where the tests are installed
\`\`\`

## Absolute rules

- No implementation work outside an accepted coding path.
- A path branch is \`path/<lowercase-id>\`, in its own worktree, with ONE writer.
- Every executed step updates code, tests, docs and the path's own ledger in the
  same work unit, and is pushed immediately.
- **A published path branch is never rewritten** — no rebase, amend,
  \`reset --soft\` fold or force-push. Reach a current base by merging
  \`${options.trunk}\` in. This repository declares
  \`pathHistoryPolicy: forbidden\`.
- Progress persists in files, never in a conversation.

| execution-state plane | \`${options.projectRoot}/\` |

The machine-readable authority is \`cairn.config.json\`, validated by
\`tools/cairn-config.mjs\` before any repository rule runs. If this table and that
file disagree, that is a binding defect — and neither is permission to write a
name from this repository into portable protocol text.

## Where the concept wiki starts

New vocabulary goes in \`${PORTABLE_DOCS}/concepts/\`, one
article per term, following
[the one-concept template](../../${PORTABLE_DOCS}/concepts/concept-template.md).
The index there separates borrowed vocabulary from Cairn-defined concepts; keep
that separation, because only the second kind is yours to change.

## Reaching a current base

\`\`\`bash
git fetch ${options.remote} ${options.trunk}
git merge ${options.remote}/${options.trunk}
\`\`\`

Do not rebase. Nothing published on a path branch is rewritten here, which is why
this repository has no checkpoint-retention namespace to fetch or maintain.
