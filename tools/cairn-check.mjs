/**
 * SHARED FILES — generated, or otherwise touched by more than one path.

 * real merges were run to check:
 *
 *   two appends to the journal        -> CONFLICT, visible, trivially resolved
 *   two edits to ADJACENT table rows  -> CONFLICT, visible
 *   two edits to DISTANT table rows   -> clean merge, and CORRECT
 *   parent closed + path added        -> clean merge, CONTRADICTORY
 *
 * Only the last fails, as a CROSS-LINE contradiction (both edits individually
 * right, jointly incoherent) that any reader spots. Git handles the rest.
 *
 * The answer was therefore never a lock. It is to stop these files being
 * shared at all: ACTIVE.md is GENERATED (cairn-active), the journal is now one
 * file per entry under the configured project log, and the root module note is an
 * index over per-area notes. What survives here is a warning — edit it by hand
 * and you are hand-writing something that is meant to be regenerated.

  // has to stop being the question.

  // needs no key at all, and that is the finding: the view is already a pure
  // projection of the statuses declared IN THIS TREE, so a checkout can only
  // disagree with it when something here moved a status without regenerating.
