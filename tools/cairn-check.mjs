/**
 * cairn-check — the Cairn protocol validator (CP-OPS-001 S04b).
 *
 * Every rule in this repository used to be enforced by an agent reading
 * Markdown and choosing to comply. That is a habit, not a process. This
 * script turns the mechanical half into something a pipeline can fail on,
 * so protocol compliance stops depending on which agent, model or human
 * produced the commit.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free and LLM-free: a dev who distrusts the whole
 * idea must be able to read it in one sitting and run it locally with the
 * same command CI runs.
 *
 *   node tools/cairn-check.mjs [--base <ref>] [--branch <name>] [--json]
 *
 * On a `path/*` branch the base DEFAULTS to the trunk, because that is the
 * comparison which decides the merge. There is no narrower form: one
 * invocation, one comparison, one verdict, on a laptop and in CI alike.
 *
 * BLOCKING failures exit 1. ADVISORY findings are printed and never fail:
 * a declared write surface is a signal, not a lock (owner ruling 4), and a
 * validator that blocks on judgment calls gets disabled within a week.
