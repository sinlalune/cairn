/**
 * cairn-audit — scaffold the coherence audit record for a path.
 *
 * Removing the integrator (owner directive, 2026-08-14) removed the person who
 * noticed two paths drifting apart architecturally. The owner's answer was to
 * delegate the noticing: "it could be an automated audit from agent after each
 * rebase or merge".
 *
 * The design constraint that follows: an agent's judgment is not deterministic,
 * costs money, and needs credentials CI should not hold — so it must never be
 * the thing that fails a build. The split:
 *
 *   the AGENT produces the judgment    reads the candidate diff against the
 *                                      architecture, the decision records, and
 *                                      the path's declared coverage
 *   CI checks binding + completeness   a deterministic gate on a
 *                                      non-deterministic activity
 *   its verdict is not machine-judged  findings are disposed by the acceptor
 *
 * This script writes the empty record, stamped with the exact implementation
 * candidate it reviews, so the check has something objective to look for. A
 * later administrative closure commit may contain the record without changing
 * that subject. Filling it in is the
 * agent's job — an unfilled record is visible as unfilled, which is the point:
 * a missing audit and a lazy audit should not look the same. `fillErrors()` is
 * what makes that true of a HOLLOWED-OUT record too: deleting the placeholder
 * is a deletion, not an audit (F10).
 *
 *   node tools/cairn-audit.mjs                        # scaffold for the current branch

# Coherence audit — ${pathId} @ ${subjectCommit.slice(0, 7)}

Run on the exact candidate, before acceptance. The judgement in this record is not a
machine verdict; its existence, completeness, and exact candidate binding are
mechanical closure gates. Its job is to catch what deterministic checks cannot
— two paths that each pass every rule and still pull the architecture in
different directions.

## What to read

- the candidate diff for this branch, against the trunk it will land on
- every architecture page and decision record named in this path's documentation coverage
- the module area notes the diff touches
- any OTHER path currently \`running\` that declares an overlapping surface

## Findings

### Does the diff contradict an accepted decision?

${PLACEHOLDER}

### Does it duplicate something another running path is building?

${PLACEHOLDER}

### Did it introduce architecture that belongs in an ADR and has none?

${PLACEHOLDER}

### Is anything now documented in two places that will drift apart?

${PLACEHOLDER}

## Verdict

${PLACEHOLDER}

*(clean · drift noted, proceeding · needs a conversation before merge)*

 * happened to it. Refusing that record would be a false verdict about a real
 * audit, and this repository's own rule is that a false verdict costs more
 * than a missed one. A record must NAME one of the three; it may qualify it.
